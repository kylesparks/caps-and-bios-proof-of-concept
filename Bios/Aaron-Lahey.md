Aaron enjoys the constant challenges of building and learning that software engineering provides every day. He is passionate about using test-driven development and proven software methodologies to create software that provides long-term value.
 
Recently, Aaron has worked to maintain and extend a user authentication service in a large-scale service-oriented architecture. The service is primarily built in JRuby on the Sinatra web framework but utilizes Java and the Spring Framework for performance-critical use cases. The service provides password, Facebook, and Google authentication as well as account-lifecycle management actions, such as password resets, password changes, email verifications, email changes, and authentication token validation.
 
Aaron has worked to unify two separate legacy platforms that managed these processes into one by migrating all traffic to this new service, making it the primary source of truth and decisions for account activity system-wide. He has also leveraged Apache Kafka, a high-throughput distributed messaging system, to create a real-time stream of user authentication events in an effort to prevent fraudulent account activity and distributed account-takeover attacks.
 
Aaron also helped import millions of  new user accounts from a separate system while simultaneously improving the security of their password storage in a backwards-compatible fashion.
 
On a previous project, Aaron worked to create more stable and reliable video playback in an interactive video streaming application built in Clojure and ClojureScript.

Before beginning his career in software development, Aaron earned his Bachelor of Arts in jazz performance and recording engineering from Millikin University.
