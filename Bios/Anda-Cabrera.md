Recently, Anda Cabrera has been helping a massive data platform add new functionality, migrate to Amazon Web Services, and introduce containerization strategies.

The platform acts as an intermediary between manufacturers and retailers by creating, managing, and displaying the nutritional content labels for the food and beverage industry. Anda has used Node.js to build a front-end application that scans barcodes, and then queries and presents data from a central MySQL database into an industry-standard format.

Anda and her team also introduced Docker containers and Ansible automation tools to all of their applications to help ensure consistent delivery and streamlined deployment pipelines. She helped configure the containers so every developer in the company’s large IT team can run the same tests and dependencies. After moving the client’s core monolithic application into Docker containers, the time required to build the application reduced from two days to 20 minutes.

More recently, Anda has begun helping to split out large processes in the main monolithic application into services with AngularJS front ends and Spring backends, each with their own individualized Docker containers. 

Prior to joining 8th Light, Anda worked as a professional administrator and consultant in several industries, including finance. Anda earned Bachelor’s degrees in English and geography from Cluj in Transylvania.
